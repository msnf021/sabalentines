You know that feeling when you find something so perfect, you can't imagine it belonging to anyone else but you? That's exactly how I feel about you. You're not just someone I care about; you're mine, in every sense of the word.
<br>
No one else gets to see the way your eyes light up when you're excited, or the way you laugh in that way I love so much. No one else will get to hold your hand, or kiss your lips, or make you smile the way I do.

                Do you agree? Are you mine?
